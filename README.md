# Shulabh Bhattarai

Computer Science undergraduate at DePauw University (Class of 2026), with a minor in Data Science and a strong foundation in full-stack development, machine learning, and applied AI. I’m passionate about building intelligent, scalable software systems that drive real-world impact.

My experience spans iOS development, NLP pipelines, and cloud-integrated applications. I’ve developed production-grade projects such as:

- **StudyAI** – An iOS app that transforms voice, images, and PDFs into AI-powered summaries and flashcards using FastAPI, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers. Designed scalable architecture with Core Data and Firebase for real-time sync and persistence.
- **Mind Matters** – A Vue 3 and Firebase-based mood tracking tool designed for mental health insights, featuring patient charting, data visualization, and secure, role-based access control.
- **Hybrid Recommender System** – Engineered a hybrid model combining clustering (K-means, hierarchical) with collaborative filtering to serve personalized anime recommendations across 70K+ users.

In past internships, I’ve built REST APIs, optimized relational databases, and applied clustering and neural networks to segment and analyze consumer behavior at scale. My backend work includes PostgreSQL query tuning, API design with FastAPI and Flask, and integration of ML models into scalable systems.

Outside of development, I serve as a TA for introductory CS courses (Python, Java, and C++) and lead workshops through the DePauw Data Science Club, where I serve as Treasurer and peer ML instructor. I also write tutorials on machine learning and clustering, with a focus on making complex concepts accessible.
